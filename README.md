# Real Time Bus Tracker
A simple exercise as part of MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
This exercise was intended to get us comfortable with the DOM and creating simple animations with Mapbox API.

# Sources
Mapbox: https://www.mapbox.com/

# To Run
For personal reasons I decided not to include my Mapbox token. Please use your own, or create a free account with Mapbox to gain a token.

# Future Development
Nothing to note other than a good place for reference.
